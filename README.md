# Bruno Chiconato - Data Engineer Portfolio

> A sleek, modern, and performant personal portfolio built with Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS to showcase projects and skills in data engineering.

## About The Project

In today's technology landscape, a personal portfolio is a developer's primary marketing asset. The goal of this project was to create a professional, visually appealing, and high-performance digital showcase that effectively communicates technical skills and project experience.

This portfolio is designed to serve as a central hub for my work, providing a clear narrative of my capabilities as a Data Engineer. It goes beyond a simple list of projects by demonstrating an understanding of modern web technologies and best practices in software development.

This project is a personalized fork of the beautiful and minimalist portfolio template originally created by [Oscar Hernandez](https://github.com/Gothsec). It has been adapted and extended to reflect my personal brand and technical focus.
